## 🧠 About Me

Aspiring data professional and current Computer Engineering student at **UNAM (7th semester)**, passionate about applying theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world environments.

I’m particularly interested in **data science**, **SQL/databases**, and the **human-technical interaction** that comes from building and supporting real systems.

I enjoy solving problems, working collaboratively, and continuously learning new tools and methods to improve performance and clarity in data-driven projects.

## 🍊 Currently at DiDi

I’m currently working at **DiDi Food**, where I:

- Automate workflows and integrate internal systems using tools like Python, Pandas, SQL, Google APIs, and Colab to streamline and connect data-driven processes.
- Document and improve key operational processes to both maintain a stable workflow in a highly dynamic market and simplify operational work, enabling me to pursue new goals and internal projects.
- Test new developments and optimize SQL queries for massive datasets, turning complex analyses into valuable insights that are often hard to uncover.

This role has strengthened my technical and analytical foundation, while giving me hands-on experience in how large-scale systems evolve and operate in real business environments.
