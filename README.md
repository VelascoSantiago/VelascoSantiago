## 🧠 About Me

Aspiring data professional and current Computer Engineering student at **UNAM (7th semester)**, passionate about applying theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world environments.

I’m particularly interested in **data science**, **SQL/databases**, and the **human-technical interaction** that comes from building and supporting real systems.

I enjoy solving problems, working collaboratively, and constantly seeking improvement in everything I do, which allows me to pursue new professional and personal goals.

## 💻 What I’ve Worked On

I have hands-on experience in:

- 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization: Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clean, process, and extract insights from data.
- 🗃️ SQL & Relational Databases: Designing and managing databases with ER modeling, views, triggers, and stored procedures. Experienced in query optimization for massive datasets.
- 🌐 APIs & Data Integration: Leveraging REST APIs to automate processes and integrate systems, including hands-on experience with Google APIs.
- 📈 Statistical Testing & Correlation Analysis: Applying statistical methods to validate hypotheses and uncover insights from real-world datasets.
- 📝 Product & Project Coordination: Authoring Business Requirement Documents (BRDs), managing feature requests, and bridging the gap between operational needs and product development.
- 💼 Cross-Functional Collaboration: Thriving in dynamic, fast-paced environments by collaborating with diverse stakeholders (Product, Ops, Marketing) and providing technical support across multiple teams.
- 🧪 Version Control & Collaboration: Proficient in using Git and GitHub for code management and team collaboration.
- 🎵 Signal Analysis & Processing: Analyzing and manipulating signals using MATLAB and Python libraries such as Spotipy to develop music-related projects and explore the intersection between data and sound.

## 🍊 Currently at DiDi

I’m currently working at **DiDi Food**, where I:

- Automate workflows and integrate internal systems using tools like Python, Pandas, SQL, Google APIs, and Colab to streamline and connect data-driven processes.
- Document and improve key operational processes to both maintain a stable workflow in a highly dynamic market and simplify operational work, enabling me to pursue new goals and internal projects.
- Test new developments and optimize SQL queries for massive datasets, turning complex analyses into valuable insights that are often hard to uncover.
