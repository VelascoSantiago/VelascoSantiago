## 🧠 About Me

Aspiring data professional and current Computer Engineering student at **UNAM (7th semester)**, passionate about applying theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world environments.

I’m particularly interested in **data science**, **SQL/databases**, and the **human-technical interaction** that comes from building and supporting real systems.

I enjoy solving problems, working collaboratively, and continuously learning new tools and methods to improve performance and clarity in data-driven projects.
